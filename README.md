## 🚀 How to Deploy

You don’t need to code anything. Just follow these simple steps:

### 1. Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Click **New Project** → Import this GitHub project.
3. Vercel will automatically set everything up.

---

### 2. Set Environment Variables
After importing the project, go to your Vercel project settings → **Environment Variables**.  
Add these two:

- `API_URL` → the URL of your FastAPI backend (we will give you this).  
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` → your Google Gemini API Key.  

That’s it! 🎉

---

### 3. Done!
- Once you add the variables and click **Deploy**, Vercel will give you a live website link.  
- Share that link with users and they can start chatting with the AI agent.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- You only need to give  **your API URL** and **Gemini API Key**.  
- You don’t have to change any code yourself.  
- Everything else (chatbot logic, design) is already handled.
